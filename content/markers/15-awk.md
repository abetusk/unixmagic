[AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) is a domain specific language designed for text
processing, either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline.

AWK was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s, and its name is
derived from the surnames of its authors: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger and Brian Kernighan.
