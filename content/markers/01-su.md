The <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">su</a> command (short for “substitute user” or
“switch user”) is used to start a shell under a different user account.
Typically, one of the most common uses of su is switching to the superuser
(root) account to gain administrative privileges.
