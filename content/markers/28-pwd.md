[`pwd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html) is a simple command
that shows your current location in the filesystem. Is it a coincidence that
`pwd` is visually presented in a box? Maybe. But perhaps it’s a visual clue,
suggesting that `pwd` is a small, self-contained tool—like many classic UNIX
commands.
