This may be a bit of a stretch, but considering how prevalent buffer overflows 
have been in the history of UNIX, the imagery might be intentional. The 
overflowing liquid from the shell could be a visual reference to a buffer overflow.

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer (a fixed 
block of memory) than it can hold. The excess data "spills over" into adjacent 
memory, often overwriting critical information like return addresses, which can 
cause crashes or open security vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows were (and still 
are) a classic type of exploit in C programming on UNIX systems.
