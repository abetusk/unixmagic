[Troff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff) is the major component of a document processing system developed by Bell Labs for the Unix operating system.
Troff stands for "typesetter roff", where `roff` is a typesetting markup language.
A typical distribution of troff includes macros for many document styles, including ones for the Unix `man` pages.

Troff was developed by Bell Labs in th 1970s, where Joseph Ossanna created `troff` by modifying `nroff` to support multiple fonts and proportional spacing.
