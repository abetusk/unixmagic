[B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)) is a programming language
designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications.
B was derived from BCPL, and its name may possibly be a contraction of BCPL.
B is an almost extinct programming language, superseded by the more modern C language.

B was developed at Bell Labs circa 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
