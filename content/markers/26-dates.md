`date` is a command to display and set a UNIX system date.

Unix time is currently defined as the number of non-leap seconds which have passed since 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970,
which is referred to as the Unix epoch.

The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit integer incrementing at a rate of 60 Hz, which was the rate of the system clock
on the hardware of the early Unix systems.
Timestamps stored this way could only represent a range of a little over two and a quarter years.

The current epoch of 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC was selected arbitrarily by Unix engineers because it was considered a
convenient date to work with.
