`login` is the gateway into the system. It authenticates the user, initializes
the environment by changing to the userâ€™s home directory, and spawns a process
running as the user (with their `uid` and `gid`), using their shell of choice.

Additionally, the standard input and output need to be attached to a terminal:
this could be a **pseudo-terminal** (if you are in a graphical interface or
using `ssh`), or a **physical terminal** (as was common at the time).
