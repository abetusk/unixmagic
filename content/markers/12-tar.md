[Tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) is a software tool for collecting multiple
files into a single archive file, often called a tarball.
The name is derived from "tape archive", as it was originally developed to write
data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own, such as devices that use magnetic tape.

The command-line utility was first introduced in the Version 7 Unix in January 1979, replacing the `tp` program (which in turn replaced `tap`).
