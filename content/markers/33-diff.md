[`diff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) is a data comparison tool that computes
and displays the differences in the contents of files.
`diff` is line oriented and is often used to determine changes between two versions
of the same file.
For example, `diff` can be used to find which lines have changed in a source file,
allowing for only transmission of the changes, rather than the whole file.

`diff` as developed in the early 1970s at Bell Labs.
