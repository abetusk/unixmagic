Users on UNIX systems may want to 
switch to other accounts, allowing for switching roles, escalation or deescalation of
privileges or might be logging into multiple machines across networks.
The [`whoami`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoami) is a command to tell the invoker
what user they are logged in as.

The earliest versions were created in 2.9 BSD.
