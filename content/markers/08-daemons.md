[Daemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) are programs that run in the background
and are often started at system boot time. They respond to network requests, hardware activity,
or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform
defined tasks at scheduled times.

The term was coined by the programmers at MIT's Project MAC. It is inspired by Maxwell's demon and
greek mythology, acting as a metaphor for a supernatural being working in the background.
