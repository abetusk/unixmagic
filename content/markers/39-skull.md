The skull connected to the shell may symbolize `/dev/null`, the special UNIX
device that discards all data written to it.
In UNIX, redirecting output to
`/dev/null` effectively sends it into a "black hole," where it is lost
forever.
Output redirection is part of a broader
[standard stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) UNIX concept that
allows outputs of one process to be redirected to the input of another.

Another interpretation is that the spigot is reminiscent of a gargoyle, perhaps
referencing a UNIX [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing))
process.

See the ([/dev/null](#annotation-10-null)) mark.
