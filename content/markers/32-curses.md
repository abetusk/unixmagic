The [`curses`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) programming
library provides a layer of abstraction over sending graphical and positioning
data directly to allow for graphical elements and cursor positioning in Unix terminals.
The name is a pun on the term "cursor optimization".

The first curses library was written by Ken Arnold and originally released with BSD UNIX.
