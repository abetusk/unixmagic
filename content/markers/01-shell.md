The prominent position of the shell in the UNIX Magic poster reflects its
central role in UNIX systems. The shell was (and still is) the primary
interface for interacting with the kernel, serving as the workbench of the UNIX
user. It is an incredibly powerful tool, allowing users to launch and
coordinate processes, perform complex computations, and interface directly with
the operating system.

The shell is not just an interface; it is also a full programming language.
Users can write scripts to automate tasks, control processes, and build
pipelines to process data efficiently. This makes the shell both interactive
and programmable—something remarkably different from other operating systems of
its time.

While many shells exist today, the original was the Bourne shell (sh), which
laid the foundation for everything that followed.

Finally, I want to emphasize that the shell is the gateway to UNIX power. It is
the first point of contact when learning UNIX, and mastering it unlocks the
system’s full potential. I believe the poster captures this perfectly—the shell
is at the heart of the wizard’s magic because it is the gateway to controlling
the system.
