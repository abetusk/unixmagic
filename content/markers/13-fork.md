In multitasking operating systems, processes need a way to create new processes.
[Forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)) a process is typically the
only way of doing so in Unix-like systems.

One of the earliest references to a fork concept appeared in A Multiprocessor
System Design by Melvin Conway, published in 1962.
