C is deeply intertwined with the history and development of the Unix operating
system. Created by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, C was
used to rewrite Unix from low-level assembly into a higher-level language. This
shift made Unix significantly more portable across different hardware
platforms, fueling its rapid adoption in academia and industry. Over time, C
evolved into one of the most influential and widely used programming languages
in history.
