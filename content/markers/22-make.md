[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) is a command line interface
that reads in a configuration `Makefile` that is often used in code executable
compilation and automation.
Before Make, building on Unix mostly consisted of shell scripts written for each program's codebase.
Make's dependency ordering and out-of-date checking makes the build process more robust and more efficient.

Stuart Feldman was the original author of Make, completing an early version in April 1976 at
Bell Labs.
