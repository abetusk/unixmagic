The **socket** is a reference to **network sockets**,
an abstraction pioneered by UNIX in BSD UNIX (4.2BSD, 1983). Sockets
provided a unified interface for interprocess communication (IPC), enabling
processes to communicate both locally (on the same machine) via UNIX domain
sockets and over a network using TCP/IP. This innovation became
foundational to modern networking, and the socket API was adopted by all
major operating systems, shaping how network programming is done today.
For more on the history of BSD sockets, see [Berkeley Sockets â€“
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets), or read the
official Linux man page for [socket()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html).
