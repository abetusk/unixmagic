The root user is the name often given to the administrator or superuser account
on UNIX systems.
In Unix-like systems, root is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or
permissions to all files and programs in all modes (e.g. single- or multi-user). 
The root user can do many things an ordinary user cannot, such as changing the
ownership of files and binding to network ports numbered below 1024.
