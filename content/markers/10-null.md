The [Null device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_device) is a device file that discards all data written
to it but reports that the write operation succeeded.
This device is called /dev/null on Unix and Unix-like systems.
The null device is typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams.
