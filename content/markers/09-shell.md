[Shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) are a computer program that exposes an operating
system's services to a person or other programs. This is often done through a command line interface or graphical
user interface.
A Unix shell's command line interpreter provides a command or scripting language to allow the operator
an interactive way of controlling the execution of system
programs and tasks.

The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, `sh`, written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs and distributed
with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975.
