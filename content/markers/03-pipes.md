<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">Pipes</a> are a
foundational feature in Unix that enable you to combine simple utilities into
more powerful workflows. By passing data from one command’s output to another
command’s input, pipes allow you to quickly create flexible, efficient, and
maintainable solutions directly at the command line. They are denoted in the
shell by the vertical bar character (|).
