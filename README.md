# Unix Magic Poster Reference Tracker

A pipeline that builds a website that maps and documents all the references
found in the classic Usenix Unix Magic poster. The goal is to create a
structured way to explore, annotate, and understand the various elements of the
poster, making it a valuable reference for Unix enthusiasts.

The UNIX Magic poster was created by *Gary Overacre* and published by UniTech
Software, Inc. in the 1980s.

When contributing, remember that this is an opportunity to dig deep into the
history behind what youâ€™re describing. Feel free to share what this particular
component means to you personally, but also aim to frame the explanation within
the context of Unixâ€™s early days. How did this functionality compare to other
operating systems at the time? What made it special or innovative? This project
is not just about explaining what things are, but understanding why they
matteredâ€”both technically and culturallyâ€”in the evolution of Unix.
