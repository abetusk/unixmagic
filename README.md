# Unix Magic Poster Reference Tracker

A pipeline that builds a website that maps and documents all the references
found in the classic Usenix Unix Magic poster. The goal is to create a
structured way to explore, annotate, and understand the various elements of the
poster, making it a valuable reference for Unix enthusiasts.

ðŸ”— You can find the latest build of this pipeline [here](https://drio.github.io/unixmagic/).
