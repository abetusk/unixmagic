# Unix Magic Poster Reference Tracker

A pipeline that builds a website that maps and documents all the references
found in the classic Usenix Unix Magic poster. The goal is to create a
structured way to explore, annotate, and understand the various elements of the
poster, making it a valuable reference for Unix enthusiasts.

The UNIX Magic poster was created by *Garrett Birek* and published by UniTech
Software, Inc. in the 1980s.
