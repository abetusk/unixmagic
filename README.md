# Unix Magic Poster Reference Tracker

This project is a **pipeline** to build a website that **maps and documents all
the references** found in the classic **Usenix Unix Magic poster**. The goal is
to create a structured way to **explore, annotate, and understand** the various
elements of the poster, making it a valuable reference for Unix enthusiasts.

ðŸ”— You can find the latest build of this pipeline [here](https://drio.github.io/unixmagic/).

Contributions welcome!
